      You can set the numbers, and units of your columns and rows, and I'll
      generate a CSS grid for you!
      <strong>Drag within the boxes</strong> to create divs placed within the
      grid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though this project can get a basic layout started for you, this project
      is not a comprehensive tour of CSS Grid capabilities. It is a way for you
      to use CSS Grid features quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      I noticed a lot of people weren't using Grid because they felt it was too
      complicated and they couldn't understand it. Grid is capable of so much,
      and this small generator only touches on a fraction of the features. The
      purpose of this is so people get up and running quickly, and create more
      interesting layouts.
